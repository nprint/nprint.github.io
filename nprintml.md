# nPrintML

nPrint provides a data format for automated traffic engineering. To facilitate automated state-of-the-art traffic analysis we have built [nPrintML](https://github.com/nprint/nprintML), which combines nPrint (the system and representation) **and** AutoML to automatically train, test, and evaluate traffic analysis tasks for a variety of use cases.


<!-- For On the analysis side, `pypcapml` leverages the standardized format, exposing a python interface that reads metadata-encoded pcapml output, enabling the user to focus on extracting interesting information from traffic sequences. By building upon a common foundation, ML researchers working on network traffic analyses can spend time and energy on making strides in advancing the state-of-the-art as a community, rather than creating one-off solutions that do not generalize. -->
