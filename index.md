<!-- # The nPrint Project -->

The nPrint project is a collection of open source software for network traffic analysis tasks:

- `nprint` provides a generic representation for machine learning based network traffic analysis
- `nprintml` combines nPrint and automated machine learning techniques for fully automated traffic analysis pipelines
- `pcapml` standardizes traffic analysis tasks at the dataset level by encoding metadata directly into raw traffic captures
- `pcapml_fe` provides a standard, easy to use interface for metadata-encoded traffic captures
